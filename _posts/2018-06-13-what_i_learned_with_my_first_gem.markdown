Ahh, the rollercoaster ride that comes with creating something new. Where to start is always a hurdle, especially when it's something you've never done before. If my years of working in kitchens and making menu's has taught me anything, its that the first step is always to take the first step. What's this mean? Do something, **even if its wrong.** That's right, even if its wrong. A mistake is just a clue to finding out how to do something right. If you make the wrong first step, that's ok. It's going to let you know you're wrong and show you where the right first step is.

My first step was to pick the website I wanted to scrape for this project. Since my fiancee and I have been looking at adopting a dog, I chose the website for our local shelter. Turns out, I didn't recognize that it was made with Javascript and Javascript is the devil, but only if you're trying to scrape information from the page. Otherwise Javascript is what makes the internet awesome. As I looked and looked for a site that didn't generate the information I was trying collect with Javascript, I came to a realization of sorts. Scraping, as it exists now, will probably become a deprecated practice in the near future. 

Once I got the scraping situation sorted out, as well the general setup, I was able to jump into the more familair territory of fleshing out the code. Since this wasn't a lab with everything set up nicely to just work, I had to really figure out how dependancies work. I had made inferences leading up to now, but hadn't really had to deal with it yet. This one was blissfully painless and took about 5 minutes to figure out. After that it was some debugging and a Gem is born.
