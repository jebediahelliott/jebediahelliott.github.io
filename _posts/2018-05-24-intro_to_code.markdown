A few years ago I began to get the creeping feeling that it was time for a career change. It slowly settled itself in and as time went on recognized that I was unhappy in the restaurant industry and it was time for a change. It's quite a daunting prospect to make a career change. What would I do? Will I like it? How will the finances work? These and many other questions plagued me as I mulled it over and tried to figure out how to escape to a new career. The first step of any big project is always to take the first step so, instead of letting all these questions stop me before I started, I began to try and figure out what I wanted to do. I had a pretty general idea of what I didn't want to do and a list of interests and curiosities, so thats where I started. After doing some research into a couple of different things I got to coding and started some free tutorials. After that it didn't take me long to realize that I had found what I was looking for. A few short weeks ago I made the leap and I can't wait to find out where I land.
