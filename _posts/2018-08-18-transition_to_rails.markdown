The structure Flatiron curriculum often reminds me of being in a math class, and that's a good thing. For those of you who care to dig up the memory, you might remember the structure of math class being something like this: 
 * Inroduce a new concept
 * Spend several hours working on complex and repetitve problems
 * Expand on the concept 
 * Spend several more hours working on slightly different complex and repetitive problems
 * Ask the teacher when you will ever need this stuff anyway
 * Introduce a new formula that makes it possible to do all those complex and repetitive problems in about 5 minutes
 * Repeat until nautious(and then keep going)
You might be thinking to yourself, "That sounds terrible, this guy is off his rocker if he thinks that is a good thing," and I would be inclined to agree with you in just about any other context. What's the difference? Unlike the majority of adults who suffered through math classes and will never need to know what inverse cosine of pie over 3 is, we will actually use this stuff, and use it all the time. We need to learn those underlying concepts or the new formula is just magic. 

So how does this apply to the Flatiron curriculum, or more specifically, Rails? Leading up to Rails has been the repetitions and conceptual understanding. Sinatra was like that awesome new formula that allows you to do all those computations exponentially faster. Rails is the calculator. Like a calculator, it is possible of doing very complex things in the blink of an eye. It's also next to useless if you don't understand how it works or what the underlying concepts are. Rails is a very exciting tool that handles all the background noise and allows you to concentrate on the specifics of the problem at hand. As I learn more about Rails, the more I realize how much there is to learn, and I can't wait to see how far the rabbit hole goes.
